#This is how I secured the way my pihole is working (and my raspbian installation, generally speaking)

1 - I gave a strong password to the root user account and make it impossible to log directly as root through ssh in the sshd_config file :
[pi@pihole ~]$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[...]
PermitRootLogin no

According to this, the only way to log as root via ssh is to log in from a different user first and use "su" command.

2 - I gave a strong password to the pi user (which is the default user created at the installation of raspbian). 
The password is obviously different from the root one.

3 - I deleted the file under /etc/sudoers.d that makes the pi user capable of using sudo without password for any commands.
This file is actually created by default during the raspbian installation. That is a big security threat/concern to me.
I find it insane to create such a file by default. Anyway, I advise you to delete it aswell so the system will ask for your password when using sudo (just like it normally should) :
[pi@pihole ~]$ sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd

4 - I gave a stong password to the pihole user (which is the default user created during the pihole installation) and I removed it from the sudo group.
This way, this user cannot run commands with sudo. I only gave him specific sudo rights (more on that on point 6).
[pi@pihole ~]$ sudo gpasswd -d pihole sudo

5 - All the script automatically running through the crontab (and the crontab itself) belong to the pihole user.
He only has the right to read and execute them :
-r-x------ 1 pihole pihole  358 févr.  7 10:20 pihole_update.sh

You might wanna say that, as the pihole user is the owner of those scripts, he can modify the rights at his convenience.
But don't worry, I took care of that on point 7.

6 - I only gave sudo right (without password) to the pihole user for those scripts (and only for those scripts).
According to that, the pihole user gain temporary sudo rights during the execution of those scripts.
This way, the pihole user doesn't have sudo rights on the entire binaries/commands used in the script, but only on what is specifically written in the scripts and only during their execution.
[pi@pihole ~]$ sudo visudo
[...]
pihole ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/home/pihole/pihole_FTL_log_management.sh,/home/pihole/pihole_log_management.sh,/home/pihole/pihole_update.sh,/home/pihole/pihole_blacklist_update.sh,/home/pihole/pihole_whitelist_update.sh

pihole@pihole:~$ sudo -l

7 - I made the pihole user account not available for login via the /etc/passwd file :
[pi@pihole ~]$ sudo vi /etc/passwd
[...]
pihole:x:999:995::/home/pihole:/usr/sbin/nologin

This way, it is not possible to log in to the pihole user account. It acts as a service user, such as www-data for apache for instance. 
It exists, it executes it's crontab, he has specific rights to do stuff that it has to do, but you canno't log in to it (at least, not without modifying the /etc/passwd file, which implies using sudo and typing your password)
